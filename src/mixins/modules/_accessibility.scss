@mixin accessibility {
    // * The following code enables the hiding of elements with the
    // * hidden attribute, but only when the browser does not support
    // * the :where pseudo-class.
    // *
    // * The :where pseudo-class is supported in modern browsers and
    // * this code is only needed for older browsers.
    // *
    // * The :where pseudo-class is more efficient than the [hidden]
    // * attribute selector as it does not create a style rule.
    // *
    // * The :where pseudo-class will be used by browsers that support
    // * it, and the [hidden] attribute selector will be used by
    // * browsers that do not support the :where pseudo-class.
    // *
    // * For more information on the :where pseudo-class, see the
    // * following resources:
    // * - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where

    @supports selector(:where) {
      :where([hidden]) {
        display: none;
      }
    }

    // * Hide elements with the hidden attribute for browsers not supporting
    // * the :where pseudo-class. This ensures that elements with the hidden
    // * attribute do not appear on the page in older browsers. The :where
    // * pseudo-class is preferred in modern browsers for efficiency.
    // *
    // * For more information, see:
    // * - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where

    @supports not selector(:where) {
      [hidden] {
        display: none;
      }
    }

    // * Change the cursor to a progress indicator when the aria-busy state is
    // * set to true.
    // *
    // * The aria-busy state is used to indicate that an element is currently
    // * performing an action such as loading or processing data. When the
    // * aria-busy state is set to true, the element should be inaccessible to
    // * the user until the action is complete.
    // *
    // * This rule is used to provide a visual indication to the user that an
    // * action is currently in progress and that the element should not be
    // * interacted with until the action is complete.
    // *
    // * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-busy

    [aria-busy="true"] {
      cursor: progress;
    }

    // * Change the cursor to a pointing hand when the aria-controls attribute is
    // * set on an element.
    // *
    // * The aria-controls attribute is used to indicate that an element controls
    // * the content of another element. When this attribute is set, the element
    // * should be clickable and should visually indicate to the user that
    // * clicking on it will control the content of the other element.
    // *
    // * This rule is used to provide a visual indication to the user that the
    // * element can be clicked to control the content of the other element.
    // *
    // * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-controls

    [aria-controls] {
      cursor: pointer;
    }

    // * Change the cursor to the default cursor when the aria-disabled attribute is
    // * set on an element.
    // *
    // * The aria-disabled attribute is used to indicate that an element is currently
    // * disabled. When this attribute is set, the element should be inaccessible to
    // * the user until it is re-enabled.
    // *
    // * This rule is used to provide a visual indication to the user that the
    // * element is currently disabled and that it cannot be interacted with.
    // *
    // * For more information on the aria-disabled attribute, see the following
    // * resources:
    // * - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-disabled

    [aria-disabled] {
      cursor: default;
    }

    // * The focus-visible pseudo-class is supported in modern browsers.
    // * It is used to indicate if the browser is currently allowing the
    // * user to focus on the element.
    // *
    // * When the focus-visible pseudo-class is supported, a focus ring
    // * is only rendered if the browser is currently allowing the user
    // * to focus on the element.
    // *
    // * For more information on the focus-visible pseudo-class, see the
    // * following resources:
    // * - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible

    @supports selector(:focus-visible) {
      :focus-visible {
        // * The outline property is used to render a focus ring around the
        // * element when it is focused. The value of max(1px, 0.15em) is used
        // * to ensure that the focus ring is at least 1px in width and
        // * scales with the element's font size.
        // stylelint-disable-next-line value-keyword-case
        outline: max(1px, 0.15em) solid currentColor;

        // * The outline-offset property is used to set the distance between
        // * the outline and the element. The value of max(1px, 0.15em) is used
        // * to ensure that the outline is at least 1px away from the element
        // * and scales with the element's font size.
        outline-offset: max(1px, 0.15em);
      }
    }

    // * The following block provides fallback styles for browsers that do not
    // * support the :focus-visible pseudo-class. The :focus-visible pseudo-class
    // * is used to indicate if the browser is currently allowing the user to
    // * focus on an element. When it is not supported, the :focus selector is
    // * used as a fallback to ensure accessibility and usability for keyboard
    // * users. This ensures a focus ring is displayed for all focusable elements.
    // *
    // * For more information, see:
    // * - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible

    @supports not selector(:focus-visible) {
      :focus {
        // * The outline property renders a focus ring around the element when
        // * it is focused. The value "max(1px, 0.15em)" ensures the focus ring
        // * is at least 1px wide and scales with the element's font size.
        // stylelint-disable-next-line value-keyword-case
        outline: max(1px, 0.15em) solid currentColor;

        // * The outline-offset property sets the distance between the outline
        // * and the element. It also uses "max(1px, 0.15em)" to maintain
        // * consistent spacing, ensuring the outline is visible without
        // * intruding on the element's content.
        outline-offset: max(1px, 0.15em);
      }
    }

    // * Scroll margin allowance above anchor links
    // * Anchor links (e.g., <a href="#anchor">Link</a>) and named anchors
    // * (e.g., <a name="anchor">Link</a>) get a scroll margin allowance above
    // * to ensure they are clearly in view. The value of 2rem is used to
    // * balance the importance of the content with the importance of the
    // * anchor link. The scroll-padding-block-start property is used to
    // * target the block-start of the element, which is the top of the
    // * element in a horizontal writing mode.
    // * This rule is essential for usability and accessibility, as it
    // * ensures that the content is not obscured by the browser's location
    // * bar or other elements.
    // * The :target pseudo-class is used to target elements that have an
    // * anchor link pointing to them. For example, the following HTML will
    // * apply the styles when the link is clicked:
    // * <a href="#section">Link</a>
    // * <section id="section">Content</section>

    :target {
      scroll-padding-block-start: 2rem;
    }

    // * Scroll margin allowance below focused elements to ensure they
    // * are clearly in view
    // *
    // * When an element is focused, such as when a user clicks on a link or
    // * uses their keyboard to navigate to an element, a scroll margin
    // * allowance is applied below the element to ensure it is clearly
    // * visible. The value of 8vh is used to balance the importance of the
    // * content with the importance of the focused element. The
    // * scroll-padding-block-end property is used to target the block-end
    // * of the element, which is the bottom of the element in a horizontal
    // * writing mode.
    // *
    // * This rule is essential for usability and accessibility, as it
    // * ensures that the content is not obscured by the browser's location
    // * bar or other elements.
    // *
    // * For example, the following HTML will apply the styles when the link is
    // * clicked:
    // * <a href="#section">Link</a>
    // * <section id="section">Content</section>

    :focus {
      // * The scroll-padding-block-end property is used to set the scroll margin
      // * allowance below the element when it is focused. The value of 8vh is used
      // * to balance the importance of the content with the importance of the
      // * focused element.
      scroll-padding-block-end: 8vh;
    }

    // * Remove all animations, transitions and smooth scroll for
    // * people that prefer not to see them. This is important for
    // * accessibility and to prevent that users with small screens or
    // * users with assistive technologies to zoom in and out to see the
    // * content.
    // *
    // * The following properties are set to prevent that the browser
    // * or the user agent to apply any animations, transitions or
    // * smooth scroll:
    // *
    // * `animation-duration` is set to `0.01ms` to prevent that the
    // * browser or the user agent to apply any animations.
    // * `animation-iteration-count` is set to `1` to prevent that the
    // * browser or the user agent to apply any animations.
    // * `transition-duration` is set to `0.01ms` to prevent that the
    // * browser or the user agent to apply any transitions.
    // * `scroll-behavior` is set to `auto` to prevent that the browser or
    // * the user agent to apply any smooth scroll.
    // * `animation-delay` is set to `-1ms` to prevent that the browser or
    // * the user agent to apply any animations.
    // * `background-attachment` is set to `initial` to prevent that the
    // * browser or the user agent to apply any background attachment.
    // * `transition-delay` is set to `0s` to prevent that the browser or
    // * the user agent to apply any transitions.
    // * `perspective` is set to `none` to prevent that the browser or
    // * the user agent to apply any 3D transforms.
    // * `transform-style` is set to `flat` to prevent that the browser or
    // * the user agent to apply any 3D transforms.
    // *
    // * The `prefers-reduced-motion` media query is used to detect if
    // * the user prefers reduced motion. If the user prefers reduced
    // * motion, the styles will be applied to all elements, including
    // * pseudo-elements. If the user does not prefer reduced motion, the
    // * styles will not be applied.

    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
      *,
      *::before,
      *::after {
        animation-duration: 0.01ms;

        animation-iteration-count: 1;
        transition-duration: 0s;
        transition-delay: 0s;
        scroll-behavior: auto;
        background-attachment: initial;
        perspective: none;
        transform-style: flat;
