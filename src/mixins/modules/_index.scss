// @description
// * A mixin that resets all basic HTML elements to their default
// * styles, which are defined by the W3C specification. This is
// * useful for ensuring that all browsers render the HTML elements
// * correctly, and for removing any default browser styles that
// * may interfere with other styles.
// *
// * You can also use the compiled files in `dist` directory as it is the
// * recommended way to use the package. The compiled files contain vendor
// * prefixes of all CSS properties which is very important in production.
// * You can read file `README.md` to know how to use the package.
