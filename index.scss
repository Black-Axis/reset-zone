// @summary
// * The current file contains two mixins that can be used to reset all
// * basic HTML elements to their default styles, which are defined by the
// * W3C specification. The first mixin is `rz()` and the second mixin is
// * `rz-layer()`. The `rz()` mixin is used to simply reset the HTML elements
// * without any CSS layers. The `rz-layer()` mixin is used to reset the HTML
// * elements and add a CSS layer to the elements. The layer is specified by the
// * first argument of the mixin. The layer is used to allow users to override
// * the default values of the CSS variables.
// *
// * You can also use the compiled files in `dist` directory as it is the
// * recommended way to use the package. The compiled files contain vendor
// * prefixes of all CSS properties which is very important in production.
// * You can read file `README.md` to know how to use the package.
